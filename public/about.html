<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I graduated from Oakland University in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science
  in Information Technology with a concentration in computer security. When I'm
  not coding or working on my computer skills, I enjoy spending time with my
  friends, walking my dog Shadow, hiking, or playing videogames.
